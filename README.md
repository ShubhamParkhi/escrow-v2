# escrow-v2

Setup:

```bash
yarn
```

The frontend is located in the `web` folder

```bash
cd web
yarn && yarn start
```

WARNING: for the record, I have temporarily deleted `yarn generate` from the web/build-netlify script, since at the moment of writing this, there are no queries/hooks from graphql done.
